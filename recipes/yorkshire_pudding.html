    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Yorkshire pudding is a savory popover-like dish made from a simple blend of eggs, milk, and flour. Yorkshire pudding was originally made with drippings from roasted meat, but many modern recipes use oil and butter in its place.</p>
    <p>The trademark puffy interior and toasted skin make Yorkshire pudding the perfect vessel for rich sauces, gravies, and meat. It can be baked in one large skillet or separated and poured into a muffin tin for easy sharing. It's a versatile dish that is just as delicious as a starter or as the centerpiece of the meal.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
